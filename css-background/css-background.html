    <div id="bgonly">The Franks, the namesake for France, were the biggest military power in Central Europe and were deeply involved in the events of early medieval Europe. But who were the Franks? According to Britannnica, The Franks were a Romanized-Germanic group residing primarily in between the Loire and Rhine Rivers. They were actually never conquered by the Romans, but frequent invasions into Gaul(France) by the Franks led to a fair bit of cultural mixing. For a while the Franks held parts of Belgium and the Netherlands, but when the Romans were busy fighting the Vandals in 406, the Frankish took control of all of Belgium and got a hold in Gaul. By 480 they had taken even more, and their dominance forced any remaining Roman authority out of Gaul and Germania. After the Romans left, there was a massive power vacuum in Central Europe, and Clovis I took advantage of it. He took over all of northern Gaul. He also managed to unite the Frankish tribes first through conquest, then by the mass conversion to Christianity. He founded the Merovingian Dynasty, which lasted for almost 300 years, although their power was mostly in name. Frankish inheritance customs made for a disastrous succession crisis every time someone died. What would happen is when a ruler died, all his titles would be split between his sons, all of whom would go to war with each other trying to consolidate their predecessor’s land. The chaotic nature of their succession gave all real power to the mayors, the rulers of cities.</div>
