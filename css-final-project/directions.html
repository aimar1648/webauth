    <p id="dirp">Milwaukee theoritcaly should be an easy place to find, seeing as it is a major city,
        but in case you can't, here's some help. Milwaukee is in SE Wisconsin, which is in the Midwest, which
        is in the United States, which is on North America, which is on Earth. For reference, Milwaukee is 93 miles north on I-94E from Chicago, if 
        you don't know where that is, I can't help you. If you are a geography kind of guy, here are Milwaukee's coordinates:
        43.0389° N, 87.9065° W.
