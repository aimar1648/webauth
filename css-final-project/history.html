    <h1>History of Milwaukee</h1>
    <p id="hisp">
        For thousands of years, Natives had lived in the Milwaukee area. It was never a specific settlement, just a reigon 
        around Lake Michigan. Some tribes you might know if you have been in wisconsin long enough, the Menominee, Fox, Sauk, and Potowatomi.
        When European fur traders arrived, many chose to settle in "Far Lake Michigan" AKA Green Bay to Milwaukee. By 1818, 3 men founded a settlement
        that would become Milwaukee, at the time being  3 seperate cities. By 1835 the mass migration would eventually form Milwaukee County and 
        the City of Milwaukee. German immigration was a huge factor in Milwaukee's growth during the late 1800s. By 1900, 34% of Milwaukee's population had 
        German heritage. Milwaukee is known as the most German city in the US, not only because of the massive migration, but the community esablished there.
