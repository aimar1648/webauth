<h1>The City of Milwaukee Welcomes You!</h1>
<p id="intro"">
    Milwaukee is a lovely city on the southeastern coast of Wisconsin. Founded in 1785 as a trading post on the shore of Lake Michigan, Milwaukee has grown the be the 31st largest city in the US.
    Milwaukee has a rich history, with many cultural influences. German heritage can be found throughout the city. There are also sizable Polish and Irish communities. But Milwaukee is far more
    diverse than that. Milwaukee's own name is from the Algonquian word millioke, which means, "pleasant land". The Natives were right.
    The city features gorgeous beaches along Lake Michigan, as well as the famous Milwaukee River. Milwaukee also has many parks to enjoy.
