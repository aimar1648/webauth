        I got off the boat in the early hours of the morning. I had to wait to break my fast as any reputable inns
        would be closed at this time. As I waited at the docks, the sun began to rise, and along with it, the denizens of 
        Kings Landing. The merchants were the first to get up, I saw them talking with the sailors, buying the silks and 
        pearls from the Free Cities, and selling pottery and jewelry.

        I got into Lannisport right as the day was ending. I had ridden with the sun all day and both he and I would rest
        as the sky darkened. Or so I thought. Lannisport is more active at night than during the day it seems. The streets
        come to life as the lanterns are lit and the people come out to enjoy the coolness of night. I ended up being far too
        tired to join them, but as I drifted off to sleep I heard the songs of bards and the laughs of glee all around me

        Whatever one gets used to in the south, is gone in the North. The gods of the south, the 7, do not exist. Rather
        the northmen worship mysterious, unamed deitys. The people are stranger too, they are always aware of the oncoming
        winter. They farm and then retire to their thick ale and their stories of the Wildlings of the even further north.
